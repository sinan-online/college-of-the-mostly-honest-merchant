# Merchant Class & The College of The (Mostly) Honest Merchant

Homebrew content for D&D 5e: This is a reskin of the "bard" class with a corresponding "college" option. It is ideal for players that want to roleplay as a merchant with some relevant magical ability. It is also good for players who want to play a merchant, but not want to use the "rogue" class.
