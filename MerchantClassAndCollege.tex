\title{The Merchant Class and the College of the (Mostly) Honest Merchant}

\section{The Merchant Class}

The Merchant class is a reskin of the Bard class, and is meant to be used with a new ``college'', called the ``College of the (Mostly) Honest Merchant''.
The purpose is to play a magically-inclined merchant, compatible with arcanapunk settings such as Eberron.\par

\subsection{College of the (Mostly) Honest Merchant}

\subsubsection{Adam Smith's Unseen Hand}

The merchant can expand one of the ``sales pitch'' (i.e. bardic inspiration) as an action to create an invisible hand.
The hand and the effect are the same as the canonical spell \emph{Mage Hand}, except (1) the hand is invisible, and (2) the hand can attack and deliver touch-range spells.
